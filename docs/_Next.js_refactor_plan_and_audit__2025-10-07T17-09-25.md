---[ ] NAME:P3.0 Review prepared custom blocks for refactor & integration DESCRIPTION:Audit user-prepared custom blocks, note DRY/SOLID issues, and prioritize fixes before migration to components/blocks.
--[ ] NAME:Phase 4: Data Fetching & Loading States – Suspense + Streaming (MEDIUM) DESCRIPTION:Audit pages that fetch data. Implement Suspense boundaries with skeletons and adopt Next.js streaming patterns.

---[ ] NAME:P4.2 Add Suspense boundaries with proper fallbacks DESCRIPTION:Introduce Suspense at segment or component level; use skeletons as fallbacks aligned with streaming patterns.
---[ ] NAME:P4.3 Adopt Next.js streaming patterns DESCRIPTION:Implement segment-level streaming in app/ routes where it improves TTFB; ensure server components handle partial render.
---[ ] NAME:P4.4 Correct fetch caching/ISR semantics DESCRIPTION:Set appropriate cache/revalidate/no-store for each data path; align with SEO and freshness requirements.
---[ ] NAME:P4.5 Verify UX under throttled network DESCRIPTION:Manual QA under slow 3G; confirm skeletons and progressive hydration behave correctly.
--[ ] NAME:Phase 5: UI/UX Revamp – Modern Minimalist (MEDIUM-LOW) DESCRIPTION:Define visual system, improve layouts, unify styles, and ensure consistent design language across pages.

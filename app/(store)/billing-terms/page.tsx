            <h2>Payment Terms</h2>
            <p>
              All payments are due at the time of purchase unless otherwise
              agreed upon in writing. We accept all major credit cards, PayPal,
              and other payment methods as displayed at checkout.
            </p>

            <h2>Billing Information</h2>
            <p>
              You agree to provide accurate, complete, and updated billing
              information. You are responsible for maintaining the
              confidentiality of your payment information and for all activities
              that occur under your account.
            </p>

            <h2>Pricing and Taxes</h2>
            <p>
              All prices are listed in USD and are subject to applicable taxes.
              Sales tax will be calculated and added to your order based on your
              billing address and local tax regulations.
            </p>

            <h2>Payment Processing</h2>
            <p>
              We use secure, encrypted payment processing services to handle
              your transactions. Your payment information is never stored on our
              servers and is processed by certified payment processors.
            </p>

            <h2>Failed Payments</h2>
            <p>
              If a payment fails, we will attempt to process it again. If
              payment continues to fail, your order may be cancelled, and you
              will be notified via email.
            </p>

            <h2>Refunds and Disputes</h2>
            <p>
              Refunds are processed according to our Return and Refund Policy.
              For billing disputes, please contact our customer service team
              within 30 days of the transaction.
            </p>

            <h2>Subscription Services</h2>
            <P>
              For recurring subscription services, you authorize us to charge
              your payment method on a recurring basis. You may cancel
              subscriptions at any time through your account dashboard.

            <h2>How We Protect Your Payment Information</h2>

            <h3>Industry-Standard Encryption</h3>
            <p>
              All payment transactions are processed using 256-bit SSL (Secure
              Socket Layer) encryption. This means your payment information is
              scrambled and protected as it travels between your browser and our
              secure servers.
            </p>

            <h3>PCI DSS Compliance</h3>
            <p>
              We maintain PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)
              compliance, which is the highest level of security certification
              available in the payments industry. This ensures that your payment
              data is handled according to the strictest security standards.
            </p>

            <h3>No Storage Policy</h3>
            <p>
              We never store your complete payment information on our servers.
              Credit card details are processed securely through our payment
              processors and are not retained in our systems after the
              transaction is complete.
            </p>

            <h3>Fraud Detection</h3>
            <p>
              Our advanced fraud detection systems monitor all transactions for
              suspicious activity. If unusual activity is detected, we may
              contact you to verify the transaction before processing your
              order.
            </p>

            <h2>Payment Process</h2>
            <p>Here&apos;s what happens when you make a payment:</p>

              <li>
                The encrypted data is sent securely to our payment processor
              </li>
              <li>Your payment is verified and processed</li>
              <li>
                We receive confirmation without storing your payment details
              </li>
              <li>You receive an email confirmation of your purchase</li>
            </ol>
